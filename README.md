## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

My maeda clock is a direct, static replication of the maeda clock that features three, pixelated numbers (the minutes, seconds and hours) overlaid over one another. I hadn't coded in four years before doing this exercise, so found it pretty useful for re-learning the p5.js system.

Next, I began planning my final clock. Inspired by Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks," I liked the idea of creating a moody, nightime vignette, where different parts of the scenery are controlled by the time. I initially planned for a street light's glow to flicker every second (although I soon realised this would look a little absurd), a man to sip from his drink every minute, and for a car to zoom past every hour. 

After visually implementing my idea into p5.js, I began seeing how I could make components change depending on the time. I ended up changing from my initial plan. I implemented a droplet leaking from a building's gutter every second (this repetitious, steady movement suited the water better than the light); a man sipping his drink every minute; and the street light's glow intensifies based on the hour. 

I struggled to implement maps and if statements (it had been a *very* long time since I touched code) but ultimately was pretty satisfied with the final result.
